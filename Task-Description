Apply Ensemble Learning Methods on Datasets



In this assignment, you have to implement three different Ensemble Learning Methods on any two of these models:
       SVM, 
       Logistic Regression, 
       and K-NN.
Visualize the insights derived from these algorithms. Compare and evaluate using appropriate performance metrics.
       EL Methods:
       Bagging.
       Stacking.
       Boosting.
You may use any dataset of your choice from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
I have attached a URL to help you understand EL Methods.

Best of luck!
