# Ensemble-Learning-Method-Higher-Education-Students-Performance-Evaluation-Dataset
The assigned task is to perform Ensemble Learning Methods on provided dataset of Higher Education Students Performance Evaluation Dataset.This Dataset describes 32 attributes in which 1-10 of the data are the personal questions, 11-16. questions include family questions, and the remaining questions include education habits. It was compiled by Dean De Cock.More details of this dataset are described in the paper: YÄ±lmaz N., Sekeroglu B. (2020) Student Performance Classification Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques.

#Task Description Requirements:
Apply Ensemble Learning Methods on Datasets
In this assignment, you have to implement three different Ensemble Learning Methods on any two of these models:
       SVM, 
       Logistic Regression, 
       and K-NN.
Visualize the insights derived from these algorithms. Compare and evaluate using appropriate performance metrics.
       EL Methods:
       Bagging.
       Stacking.
       Boosting.
You may use any dataset of your choice from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
I have attached a URL to help you understand EL Methods.

Best of luck!
