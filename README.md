# Ensemble-Learning-Method-Higher-Education-Students-Performance-Evaluation-Dataset
The assigned task is to perform Ensemble Learning Methods on provided dataset of Higher Education Students Performance Evaluation Dataset.This Dataset describes 32 attributes in which 1-10 of the data are the personal questions, 11-16. questions include family questions, and the remaining questions include education habits. It was compiled by Dean De Cock.More details of this dataset are described in the paper: YÄ±lmaz N., Sekeroglu B. (2020) Student Performance Classification Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques.

#Task Description Requirements:<br>
Apply Ensemble Learning Methods on Datasets<br>
In this assignment, you have to implement three different Ensemble Learning Methods on any two of these models:<br>
      1) SVM, <br>
      2) Logistic Regression, <br> 
      3) and K-NN.<br>
Visualize the insights derived from these algorithms. Compare and evaluate using appropriate performance metrics.<br>
       EL Methods:<br>
       1)Bagging.<br>
       2)Stacking.<br>
       3)Boosting.<br>
You may use any dataset of your choice from UCI Machine Learning Repository.<br>
I have attached a URL to help you understand EL Methods.<br>

Best of luck!<br>
